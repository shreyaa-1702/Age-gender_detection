**Age & Gender Detection**

ðŸ“Œ **Project Overview**

This project detects a person's age and gender from images using deep learning and OpenCV and model processes facial images and classifies them into predefined age groups and gender categories.

ðŸ›  **Technologies Used**

Python

OpenCV (Computer Vision)

Deep Learning (DNN module in OpenCV)

Pre-trained Models for Age & Gender Classification

ðŸš€ **Implementation Steps**

Load the Pre-trained Models for face detection, age prediction, and gender classification.

Preprocess Images: Convert to the required format and normalize pixel values.

Detect Faces using OpenCVâ€™s Deep Neural Network (DNN) module.

Predict Age & Gender from the detected face.

Display Results with bounding boxes and labels.

ðŸ“‚ **Dataset**

The model uses pre-trained datasets for:

Age Classification (e.g., 0-2, 4-6, 8-12, etc.)

Gender Classification (Male/Female)
